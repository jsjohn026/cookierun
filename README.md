# Cookie Run

Cookie Run is a game designed to be easy to pick up and quick-paced. Gameplay consists of using the spacebar to propel the player through hoops to move forward and collect various delicious cookies. 

## Background and Overview

Although it is simple and repetitive, the game will vary in pace to give players a sense of confidence at the start and gradually increase difficulty. This is based on the psychological concept of "Flow" (introduced by positive psychologist Mihaly Csíkszentmihályi) where the level of challenge and skill are balanced in an "optimal experience" so captivating that an individual loses track of time. 

Cookie Run is inspired by Flappy Bird and Super Mario Bros. Graphics, storyline, and music are designed to be bright, fun, and simple to evoke simultaneous feelings of joy and calmness.
