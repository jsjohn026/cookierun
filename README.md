Cookie Run is a game designed to be easy to pick up and quick-paced. Gameplay consists of using the right, left and up arrow to move the player around the screen and collect chocolate chip cookies. Missed cookies disintegrate the stones that keep the player from falling and drowning.

## Background and Overview

Although it is simple and repetitive, the game will increase in pace to give players a sense of confidence at the start and gradually increase difficulty. This is based on the psychological concept of "Flow" (introduced by positive psychologist Mihaly Csíkszentmihályi) where the level of challenge and skill are balanced in an "optimal experience" so captivating that an individual loses track of time. 

Cookie Run is inspired by Flappy Bird and Super Mario Bros. Graphics, storyline, and music are designed to be bright, fun, and simple to evoke simultaneous feelings of joy and calmness. 

## Functionality

   - Player can use the up arrow button to jump
   - Gaps will be generated in the path of the player
   - The game ends if the player falls into water
   - Each consumed cookie is tracked as a score
   - The score of each run is recorded and saved. A top scoring players list appears at the end of each game. 
   - The game has multiple levels of difficulty
